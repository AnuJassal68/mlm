											Nations around the world are funnelling the mainstream into the digital payment system and away from cash through soft bans. They may be doing it for economic control over all transactions, and the ability to record and tax every transaction in the future, and Bitcoin is the future as it is a digital currency in real sense.

										</p>
										<p>
											Bitcoin has not gone viral yet, and is still developing the apps, upgrades, and protocols that will make it truly ready for prime time, so the upside potential is still huge. We’ve only scratched the surface of what a Bitcoin is really worth to the world. It’s quite a bit more than $1000 already. Five year’s ago, it was worth $0.30 USD cents.
										</p>
										<p>
											Hence, Bitcoins have a great future. Every small penny you going invest in Bitcoin, is going to pay to success in it.
