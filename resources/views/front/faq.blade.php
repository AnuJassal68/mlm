												It’s necessary to create an account using your email address. Then you should check your email and log on by using the received data. As soon as you enter the site you get 15 Kh/s and your mining starts. You can control the statistics of earned crypto-currency every day on the Transaction page. If you like the productivity of this service you can purchase the powers on the Buy page.

												If you want to make a purchase it’s necessary for you to have a Bitcoin-wallet. We recommend you to create this wallet via the service https://blockchain.info/. 
You can also create your wallet in any other convenient way. You can find out more about Bitcoin-wallet on the site https://bitcoin.org/. Thereafter you can choose desired volume of purchase and pay it via your Bitcoin-wallet.

												To ensure the high output power our hardware mines different types of crypto-currency at the same time. Then our specialists exchange them for Bitcoin on the best terms. We could have made payments in different crypto-currencies but in this case our users would have to make an exchange on their own and for the most part the final output power could be way below.

												As long as we use video cards for mining it is generally agreed to measure their capacity in Kh/s. In fact, the productivity of video cards can be measured according to their cryptographic algorithm. For the capacity rating of video cards we use Scrypt algorithm.

												We have introduced a concept of a “Unit” by which we understand the video card Radeon R9 280 X Gigabyte (GV-R928XOC-3GD) that has productivity around 700 Kh/s.  From there, if the total capacity is 2 800 Kh/s we consider this as a combined working process of 4 video cards. And if we have your request for hardware purchasing you will get 4 video cards Radeon R9 280X Gigabyte (GV-R928XOC-3GD).

												Yes, our customers just get the hardware at wholesale. But our profit is 10% of daily output power and we get this profit as a result of exchanging crypto-currencies for Bitcoin. Therefore the output power of the service is shown with our profit that we earn by exchanging crypto-currencies.
